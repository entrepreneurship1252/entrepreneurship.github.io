   <p> An entrepreneur is an individual who creates a new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards. 
     The process of setting up a business is known as entrepreneurship. 
     The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator, a source of new ideas, goods, services, and business/or procedures.
     Entrepreneurs play a key role in any economy, using the skills and initiative necessary to anticipate needs and bringing good new ideas to market. 
     Entrepreneurship that proves to be successful in taking on the risks of creating a startup is rewarded with profits, fame, and continued growth opportunities. 
     Entrepreneurship that fails results in losses and less prevalence in the markets for those involved.</p>

	   <h2>HOW ENTREPRENUERSHIP WORKS</h2>
	   <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Entrepreneurship is one of the resources economists categorize as integral to production, the other three being land/natural resources, labor, and capital. An entrepreneur combines the first three of these to manufacture goods or provide services. They typically create a business plan, hire labor, acquire resources and financing, and provide leadership and management for the business.
          </p>
          
        <h3>kinds of Entrepreneurship</h3>
	   
           <p>The majority of the people may think that the term entrepreneurship has one single meaning. However, like mentioned earlier, the term is quite elastic and has a wide range of different meanings. The two most popular kinds of entrepreneurship are entrepreneurship of start-ups and entrepreneurship of small businesses</p>
	   
        <h3>Entrepreneurship as a career option</h3>
	   
           <p>For any enthusiast in the corporate world, starting your own business may prove to be a remarkable idea. Having control over the work you do is something that many people long for in their career paths. Therefore, entrepreneurship is a great career option for those willing to make their name in the corporate world.</p>
	   
        <h3>Purpose/ Uses of Entrepreneurship</h3>
	   
           <p>Choosing a career path in order to gain profit for the long haul is the most important reason why people opt for entrepreneurship. Maintaining a reliable source of income is the best and the most important way to create a stable job.</p>
	   
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Entrepreneurs commonly face many obstacles when building their companies. The three that many of them cite as the most challenging are as follows:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ol> 1.Overcoming bureaucracy </ol>
				<ol> 2.Hiring talent</ol>
				<ol> 3.Obtaining financing</ol>

    <p>
		Economists have never had a consistent definition of "entrepreneur" or "entrepreneurship" (the word "entrepreneur" comes from the French verb entreprendre, meaning "to undertake"). Though the concept of an entrepreneur existed and was known for centuries, the classical and neoclassical economists left entrepreneurs out of their formal models: They assumed that perfect information would be known to fully rational actors, leaving no room for risk-taking or discovery. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that economists seriously attempted to incorporate entrepreneurship into their models.
    </p>

		 <h3>Resources for Entrepreneurs</h3>
        There are a variety of financing resources for entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. Obtaining a small business loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA) can help entrepreneurs get the business off the ground with affordable loans. SBA helps connect businesses to loan providers.<br>

        If entrepreneurs are willing to give up a piece of equity in their business, then they may find financing in the form of angel investors and venture capitalists. These types of investors also provide guidance, mentorship, and connections in addition to just capital.<br>

        Crowdfunding has also become a popular way for entrepreneurs to raise capital, particularly through Kickstarter. An entrepreneur creates a page for their product and a monetary goal to reach while promising certain givebacks to those who donate, such as products or experiences.

	<h3>Questions for Entrepreneurs </h3>
     Embarking on the entrepreneurial career path to “being your own boss” is exciting. But along with all your research, make sure to do your homework about yourself and your situation.

    <h3> A Few Questions to Ask Yourself: </h3>
<ul> 
	<li> Do I have the personality, temperament, and mindset of taking on the world on my own terms? </li>
    <li> Do I have the required ambiance and resources to devote all my time to my venture? </li>
    <li> Do I have an exit plan ready with a clearly defined timeline in case my venture does not work? </li>
    <li> Do I have a concrete plan for the next "x" number of months or will I face challenges midway due to family, financial, or other commitments? Do I have a mitigation plan for those challenges? </li>
    <li> Do I have the required network to seek help and advice as needed? </li>
    <li> Have I identified and built bridges with experienced mentors to learn from their expertise? </li>
    <li> Have I prepared the rough draft of a complete risk assessment, including dependencies on external factors? </li>
    <li> Have I realistically assessed the potential of my offering and how it will figure in the existing market? </li>
    <li> If my offering is going to replace an existing product in the market, how will my competitors react? </li>
    <li> To keep my offering secure, will it make sense to get a patent? Do I have the capacity to wait that long? </li>
    <li> Have I identified my target customer base for the initial phase? Do I have scalability plans ready for larger markets? </li>
    <li> Have I identified sales and distribution channels? </li>
</ul>
    <h3> Questions That Delve into External Factors: </h3>
<ul>	
    <li> Does my entrepreneurial venture meet local regulations and laws? If not feasible locally, can I and should I relocate to another region? </li>
    <li> How long does it take to get the necessary license or permissions from concerned authorities? Can I survive that long? </li>
    <li> Do I have a plan about getting the necessary resources and skilled employees, and have I made cost considerations for the same? </li>
    <li> What are the tentative timelines for bringing the first prototype to market or for services to be operational? </li>
    <li> Who are my primary customers? </li>
    <li> Who are the funding sources I may need to approach to make this big? Is my venture good enough to convince potential stakeholders? </li>
    <li> What technical infrastructure do I need?</li>
    <li> Once the business is established, will I have sufficient funds to get resources and take it to the next level? Will other big firms copy my model and kill my operation? </li>
</ul>
